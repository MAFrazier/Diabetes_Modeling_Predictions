## <ins>Project Overview<ins>
### This project uses machine learning to create a modeling prediction to determine if a patient is likely to have Diabetes. To do this a number of variables and their outcome relationship to the likelihood of diabetes were evaluated. 
### Variables:
- Age : at least 21 years old of the same heritage (all females)
- Blood Pressure : Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- BMI : Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF) : function scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- Glucose : Plasma glucose concentration, a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- Insulin : 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- Pregnancies : Number of times pregnant
- Skin Thickness : Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
### Correlation Matrix - how each variable is an indicator for the likelihood of diabetes diagnosis
### Data Preparation - Analyzing and interpreting the data presented in the CSV file.
### Model Building - Steps implemented to develop the model for diagnosing predictions.
### Evaluation - Results for before and after model optimization.
### Prediction - Manually inputting values to assess the model's diagnostic predictive capabilities.
